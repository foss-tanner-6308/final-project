                    Hello! I was recently exposed to someone who now has the virus. I work in fast food and work very
                    closely with the public and my coworkers. I have texted my boss and alerted her about my situation.
                    My mom is angry at me and is scared of the consequences she will receive as a result of my very
                    THOUGHT OUT decision. All I am trying to do is protect the people around me and my mother is angry
                    at me and when this is the most considerate decision I have made in a long time. Am I wrong for
                    doing this?

                    Enough with the baseless rah-rah nonsense. The economy is cooked. We won't recover from this for
                    decades, if ever. It's doubtful that any of us see a meaningful recovery in our lifetimes. 30
                    million out of work. Do you have any idea how long it will take for the job market to recover?

                    If you have a fever, call your doctor. Call any doctor. DO NOT take advice from an online forum or
                    elsewhere about not needing Tylenol. Fevers that are too high can be life-threatening. Summary: CALL
                    YOUR DOCTOR.

                    Started a business last year and started shipping product a couple months ago, then CV happened.
                    What to do when you're not selling product? Use time and expertise to make a difference. Nearly 1000
                    face shields almost finished and testing an intubation shield tomorrow.

                    From an NYC ER nurse... we are tired. I work in one of the city's busiest emergency rooms, if not
                    the busiest and we are exhausted to the point of tears, not to froget we are not properly protected
                    either due to lack of gear. If you see a nurse, say hi, smile, wave, buy their coffee, air five.
                    Anything, it means a lot.

                    I think we should have a holiday once this is all over that is meant to commemorate the job done by
                    doctors, nurses, paramedics, essential employees and all the philanthropist acts that are going on
                    right now.

                    No, you should not inject disinfectants into your body to combat the novel coronavirus. Trust me, I
                    would know.
